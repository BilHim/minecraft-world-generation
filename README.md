This is an attempt to replicate Minecraft world generation in Python.
This is part of an [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/replicating-minecraft-world-generation-in-python-1b491bc9b9a4) published on Medium.


## Source code
You can find all the code used in the article [here](https://github.com/BilHim/minecraft-word-generation/blob/main/src/Minecraft%20Terrain%20Generation%20in%20Python%20-%20By%20Bilal%20Himite.ipynb).

## Figures
I used multiple scripts to generate the figures used in the article. Some of the code along with the figures are available [here](https://github.com/BilHim/minecraft-word-generation/tree/main/figures).
